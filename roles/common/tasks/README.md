Existing tasks here are different ways to install software:

- by downloading a deb package from internet (only if it has not been already installed) and install it
- add a custom apt repository, signature key, and install the package from the repository 
- by downloading a windows exe (again if it has not been installed already) and run wine against it

And later `include`-d from the tasks from other roles accordingly parametrized with `include` variables.
